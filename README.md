## Question 2 - Explain your target audience
- Who could be interested in reading your final report and for whom will your project be useful?
- Assess the level of expertise in relation to data science of your audience (for example, how technical should your report/presentation be?).

## Question 3 - What data sources will you need to answer your project question(s)? Describe any potential issues you can have with the datasets and how will you overcome this:
