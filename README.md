- [Question 4 - Describe the team approach to the project work](#question-4---describe-the-team-approach-to-the-project-work)


## Question 1 - What is your project question(s) and the problem it tackles?
- You will be marked on how realistic the problem is given the project timeline, as well as the fit with the subjects covered throughout the Data Specialisation and your personal, common interests in the topic.
  
How did misinformation spread during the pandemic, and what effect did it have on vaccination rates, compliance with public health measures, or mental health?


Topics to Explore:

Vaccination Rates:
- Explore how fear-mongering and misinformation influenced vaccination rates —> What effect did misleading information have on people’s willingness to get vaccinated?
  
Misinformation’s Influence on Workplace Attitudes:

- Examine how misinformation, both during and post-COVID, shaped attitudes in the workplace —> what are the potential impacts on employees' mental health and work performance.
  
Impact on Student Performance:

- Investigate how misinformation about COVID-19 or the pandemic itself affected student performance at school or university.--> What challenges or barriers did misinformation create for students?

  
Problem it tackles:
Our project aims to address the pervasive impact of misinformation during the COVID-19 pandemic, specifically how it affected public health behaviours, mental health, and societal compliance with health initiatives. Our aim is to provide insights that will inform the government or public health bodies in designing effective mental health initiatives, counter-misinformation campaigns, and preventive measures to protect public well-being in future health crises.


In addition to informing policy / research, our project seeks to engage the public’s curiosity and raise awareness about the various forms and risks of misinformation, fostering a more informed and resilient society better equipped to discern reliable information in times of crisis.



## Question 2 - Explain your target audience
- Who could be interested in reading your final report and for whom will your project be useful?
- Assess the level of expertise in relation to data science of your audience (for example, how technical should your report/presentation be?).
- You will be marked on correctly identifying your audience and the technical level of your presentation and report.

We want our report to not be too technical and aim to make it easy-to-read and easily understandable

Our main target audience: 
- public interest
- main clients - Department of public mental health + Government


## Question 3 - What data sources will you need to answer your project question(s)? Describe any potential issues you can have with the datasets and how will you overcome this:
- For example, will the data you find only cover particular geographical areas? Will you need to combine multiple datasets to overcome this?

Google trends for keywords / trending words that spread misinformation that we will scrape from datasets and the different categories which are most used as misinformation
bad data across which geographical regions? Is there a pattern? (reliability of data is a standard issue)
craziest misinformation / craziest bad data

Could do a true/ false fun quiz like ‘does eating lemons prevent Covid?’ 



## Question 4 - Describe the team approach to the project work:
- How are you planning to distribute the workload and how are you planning to work on your project;
- What are your team’s strengths and weaknesses;
- How are you managing your code;
- Include an expected timeline of the project

We will use a project management tool to organise our work i.e Jira / Kaggle

Strengths:
We have a  range of backgrounds in our team, thus a range of soft and hard skills such as communication, adaptability, teamwork, and active listening, python, sql to bring to the team.
We are all open-minded and are receptive to each other’s ideas entirely

General weaknesses:
Working with APIs
The team have lots of ideas, it's hard to come to a conclusion!
Perhaps they will become apparent further along the project
