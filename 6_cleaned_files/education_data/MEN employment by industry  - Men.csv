1 The breakdown by industry sector for Q1 2009 onwards is not entirely consistent with those of previous quarters. This is because: ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"(a) LFS data on industrial activity were coded directly to SIC 1992 for all quarters up to and including Q4 2008 and then mapped to the new industrial classification, SIC 2007, according to the assumed relationship between the two classifications;",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
(b) data for Q1 2009 onwards have been coded directly to SIC 2007; and,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"(c) a new, automatic coding tool was introduced in January 2009.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The effect of these changes on the time series was significant for some of the industry sectors shown. Consequently some adjustments have been made to the pre-2009 estimates to account for the estimated combined effects of the new classification and the new coding tool.  This also means that the pre-2009 estimates in this table are not the same as those obtained from LFS microdata. ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
More information and analysis of these effects are available in the Labour Force Survey User Guide (Volume 1) and from Labour Supply Branch (labour.supply@ons.gov.uk).,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2 Includes people with workplace outside UK and those who did not state their industry.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3 In the LFS the distinction between public and private sector is based on respondents’ views about the organisation for which they work. The public sector estimates provided here do not correspond to the official Public Sector Employment estimates which are based on National Accounts definitions.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"4 Data from July to September 2022 onward has been reweighted, causing a step change discontinuity.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Note: As the estimates are not seasonally adjusted, it is best practice to only compare the same quarter for different years (e.g., compare January-March 2018 with January-March 2019 but do not compare July-September 2018 with January-March 2019).",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
